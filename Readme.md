# Apple Card Statement Parser

The Apple Card has great privacy features, which I like, but limited data export, which
is an inconvenience.  So far, I can only export monthly statements as a PDF file.

This tool will parse an apple statement PDF to a single CSV file which can then be imported 
to a spreadsheet program.  

I add columns for category and a "shared" flag.  

This parser worked on the September statement.  I don't think Apple will change statement format
that often, but the card is a new product so this parser must be considered in Alpha stage.
